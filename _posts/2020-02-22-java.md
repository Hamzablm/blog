## Introduction

Greetings!

Specifying the generic type allows Java to perform type checking at compile-time. But when using generics in your code, due to “*Type Erasure”* that occurs at compile-time, *generic type parameters* are converted to the `Object` type. This makes *generic* *type parameters* unable to call other methods except for the `Object` ones.

What if we want to invoke methods other than that those in `Object` class? This article explains what “*Wildcards*”, “*bounds*” and “*Type Erasure*” are. And how to use Wildcards to increase flexibility when using generics.

## Type Erasure

Wikipedia defines Type erasure as:
> **Type erasure** is the load-time process by which explicit type annotations are removed from a program, before it is executed at run-time.

This example uses generics so we can use it with multiple types.

```java
class Container<T> {
    private T contents;

    public Container(T contents) {
        this.contents = contents;
    }

    public T getContents() {
        return contents;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Container<String> container = new Container<>("Hello!");
        String contents = container.getContents();
        System.out.println(contents);// Hello!
    }
}
```

You may think when typing `Container<String> container = new Container<>(“Hello!”);` you’re replacing the type `T` with `String`. But this is not the case, at compile-time, the Java compiler removes the generic type parameter `T` from the code and replaces it with the `Object` type:
```java
class Container {
    private Object contents;

    public Container(Object contents) {
        this.contents = contents;
    }

    public Object getContents() {
        return contents;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Container container = new Container("Hello!");
        String contents = (String) container.getContents();
        System.out.println(contents);
    }
}
```

Notice how `String contents = container.getContents();` is transformed to `String contents = (String) container.getContents();` As you can see the compiler inserted a cast when invoking `getContents()` method.

## Wildcard generic type

A wildcard, represented by `?` is useful when you want to define a “whatever type.”

### Unbounded wildcard

One of the generics constraints is you cannot, for example, pass `List<Integer>` argument to `List<Object>` parameter; doing so would result in a compile-time error. It is actually a good thing because Java is protecting you from you!

```java
public static void processList(List<Object> list) {
    for (Object o : list)
    System.out.print(o);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2);
    processList(numbers); // compile-time error
}
```
This example isn’t functioning because `List<Integer>` isn’t a subtype of `List<Object>`. As you might expect the `List<Object>` type in the `processList` parameter needs to be replaced with `List<?>` (read: *list of unknown type*)

Now I can pass any kind of List to `processList` method:

```java
public static void processList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object o : list)
        System.out.print(o);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Integer> list = List.of(1, 2);
    processList(list);// 12

    System.out.println();
    List<String> strings = List.of("Hello", "World!");
    processList(strings);// HelloWorld!
}
```

### bounded wildcard

Using *bounded* *wildcards* allows the compiler to enforce a restriction on the type. This example demonstrates the power and safety benefits of the bounded wildcard:

```java
public static void transformList(List<? extends CharSequence> list) {
    List<Integer> charsCount = list.stream()
            .map(CharSequence::length)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    System.out.println(charsCount);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<String> stringList = List.of("Hello", "World", "!");
    transformList(stringList);// [5, 5, 1]
    List<StringBuilder> stringBuilders = List.of(new StringBuilder("Java"), new StringBuilder("Rocks"));
    transformList(stringBuilders);// [4, 5]
}
```

What `transformList` does is it takes a `List` and transform it into a `List<Integer>`, expressing each element’s length.

Notice the parameter of `transformList` is `List<? extends CharSequence>` which means that this method will accept any list which is upper-bounded to `CharSequence` like `List<String>`, `List<StringBuilder>`, any list that has a subtype of `CharSequence` can be passed as an argument to this method.

## Wrap up

In this post, I attempted to clarify the concept of Type Erasure and introduced you to wildcards and bounds. Still, there is much more to learn from generics.
